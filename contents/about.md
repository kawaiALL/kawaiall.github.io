I am a historian of Hong Kong, late imperial and modern China, and the Asian maritime world. My thematic interests include frontiers and borderlands, empires and colonialism, race and ethnicity, and the Chinese diaspora. I am completing a monograph that employs the analytical framework of “frontier” to reinterpret the nature of the Opium War (1839-1842) and its significance in the history of the British Empire in Asia and the Qing Empire. My other research projects concern the profound impact of the Opium War on Chinese littoral societies in Asia, the Opium War in the Jiangnan region, the making of littoral space and people in nineteenth-century Hong Kong, and the political-cultural representations of the Dan as a littoral “nationality” in twentieth-century China.
